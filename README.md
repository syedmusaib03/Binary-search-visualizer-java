# Binary-search-visualizer-java
This project is a simple graphical visualization of the Binary Search algorithm using Java and Swing. It allows users to input a sorted array and a target number to search. The algorithm runs step by step with a delay, and visually highlights the low, mid, and high indices at each iteration.
